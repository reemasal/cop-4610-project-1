We found this project to be incredibly hard. Implementing Fork required duplicating the parent's address space, which was riddled with issues like memory allocation errors, and debugging behaviors during context switches. We also ran into issues with getting the testing to work and consitently ran into errors with `machine/translate.cc` file even though the programs compiled.

Overall we think this assignment had a lot of gaps with someone that is unfamiliar with the project will 100% have trouble in implementing.
